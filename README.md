# Challenges and Learnings :books:
Socialize is the first MERN application I've built, thus I exprienced a lot of new insights and learning through out its creation process. Some of the main skills I've improved or learnt are implementing user authentication with JWT & Google OAuth, using Material UI in conjunction with styled-components to achieve the styles I desire, and the process of connecting the frontend with the backend using axios, node and express.
